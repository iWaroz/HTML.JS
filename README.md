HTML.JS is a full stack javascript framework in which you don't need to write any javascript.

## Contributing
This demo was made mainly as satire, and as such is incomplete and does not provide any debugging help. If you want to make changes to improve the framework, go ahead lol

## Setup
Download the repository files into a node.js project and make sure to run the `main.js` file on execution. This will run your `main.html` file which is to contain your backend code.
